# The Librarian: experiments

Experiments with an AI librarian in vrlbry's library, in a repository of their own, a fork of
vrlbry's main: AriaMoKr/librarian, with a site of its own, <https://ariamokr.github.io/librarian/>
(CLAUDE.md, "Branches and sites"). These are the proposals, cheapest first, each one something to
try on its own.

**Built so far** (SPEC §5.10): experiment 1, steps 1 to 3 of 4.
- **The words, in the library card:** a question becomes a search, then an answer with what it
  found, and *Take me there* goes to it as the search's results do. It works on a desktop (L), a
  phone and a TV.
- **The figure beside the stand:** he faces where you arrive and turns towards you as you come
  near. Clicking or tapping him, or a TV's OK with the dot on him, goes into the card's question
  box. In VR you point at him and pull the trigger, and his panel opens with the stand's keyboard,
  his answer and what he found. He costs 1 draw call, his panel 1 more while it is open.
- **The walk:** *Take me there* and he goes ahead along a way round what stands in the room (a
  grid over the floor, made once per room, and A* across it), you follow, eased, and he stands
  beside the shelf as the book comes out to you. A soft line on the floor shows the way while you
  go (1 draw call). On a screen the view turns the way you go; in VR your head keeps its own turn,
  the comfort vignette closes with the speed, a long way's middle is skipped in a blink, and the
  turn to the shelf is a blink. A click, a tap, Enter, Esc or the trigger is there at once; with
  less motion it is the cut it was. Later he walks back to the desk.

Step 4 is still to come: his voice.

The model is the Librarian of Neal Stephenson's *Snow Crash* (1992): a daemon who fronts a vast
library in the Metaverse, appears as a pleasant silver-haired man in a sweater and tie, and finds,
retrieves and cross-references anything at once, but will not speculate or draw conclusions. He
can only find things; what they mean is the reader's to work out.

## The experiments

### 1. A librarian at the desk, no AI yet

A figure near the kiosk takes a question and answers it with the search the app already has
(titles and authors: `search.js`; Wikipedia articles and their redirects: `searchIndex`,
`searchRedirects`), then leads you to the book: walks to the shelf or lights a path, and hands it
to you (`interaction.ensureShelved`, `interaction.openArticle`). It can speak its answers with the
browser's speech synthesis (`speechSynthesis`).

This builds the body, the conversation panel (common's `Panel`, SPEC §5.5; `interaction.notice`
for a word in the headset) and the "take me there" part that every later experiment reuses. It
works offline and on the Quest.

### 2. "I can only find things": answers with citations

A language model gets the library as tools: search titles, search articles, search the full text
(Kiwix's Xapian indexes: [SEARCH.md](SEARCH.md#kiwixs-search-indexes-xapian)), read a chunk of a
book or article (`ArchiveLibrary.chunk`), open a book at a passage. Like Stephenson's Librarian,
it never speculates: every statement points to a source, a book and a block anchor `{c, b}`, and
selecting the source opens the book at that exact paragraph. This is the core of the idea, and the
citation rule also keeps the model from making things up.

- It runs through the Node server (a route beside `server/http.js`'s), because the static site
  cannot hold an API key. The key goes in the server's environment, set by hand, never through
  chat; or a local model (Ollama) instead.
- It is opt-in: a question sent to a hosted model leaves the device.
- It would use Claude Haiku 5.5 (`claude-haiku-5-5`) or Sonnet 5.5 (`claude-sonnet-5-5`).

### 3. Cross-references between libraries

While you read *Moby-Dick* from Gutenberg, the librarian offers the Wikipedia article on Melville,
his other works on Wikisource, and the articles a passage mentions. A first version can match
titles and authors without any AI; the model from experiment 2 can add looser connections later.
This makes the separate ZIMs feel like one library.

### 4. Voice in VR

VR has no keyboard, so speaking is the natural way in: hold a controller button
(`xr/controls.js` `button` events), speak, hear the answer. The first step is a measurement:
whether Quest Browser supports the browser's speech recognition (`SpeechRecognition`) at all. If
not, the options are speech recognition on the server, or a small Whisper model in the browser
(heavy).

### 5. A model on the device

A probe of whether a small language model runs in the browser over WebGPU, on the desktop and on
the Quest: tokens per second, memory, and whether the room still holds 72 Hz (measured with
`tools/quest-perf.mjs`). Nothing would leave the device, but the Quest probably cannot do both at
once. This tells us whether that route is open at all.

## Where to start

1, then 2. Experiment 1 settles the figure, the panel and walking you to the book; experiment 2
then plugs a model into the same desk, and its citation rule is what makes it the Librarian rather
than a chatbot.

To decide before experiment 2: a hosted model with an API key, or a local model.

## Ground rules

These follow the project's own (CLAUDE.md, TODO.md):

- **Optional.** The library works exactly as now without the librarian; no model, server or
  network service is ever required to open and read a book.
- **No telemetry.** The page reports nothing about its visitors. A question goes to a model only
  when someone asks one, opted in, and nothing is logged beyond that.
- **The Quest is the target.** The figure and its panel stay within the draw-call budget, per-frame
  code allocates nothing, and nothing heavy runs in one frame.
- **English first.**
